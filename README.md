Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for MIT's operating systems course. In this project, we have implemented three mini-projects to learn about different aspects of the operating system. In the first project, we have implemented a new system call and a lottery scheduler; in the second project, we add support for handling the null pointer in the Xv6. In the final project, we added the multithreading to the Xv6 that supports the Spinlock and the Queue-based lock.
